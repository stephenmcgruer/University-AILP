# AI Large Practical

This repository contains my coursework for the 3rd Year [AI Large Practical](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/ailp) course, taken in 2010/2011. There were two pieces of coursework during the AILP course, both based on character identification using [Dynamic Time Warping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping) - the first dealt with isolated characters, whilst the second handled entire words. The two courseworks are best described by their respective reports (report.pdf in both sub-folders).

Coursework for other courses can be found in my main [University Coursework](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University) repository.

70-80% (from memory)

## Known Errors ##

In Coursework 2, the "One-Stage Dynamic Programming" method almost definitely has an incorrect implementation, as it showed very poor results despite being known to be a surperior approach.
